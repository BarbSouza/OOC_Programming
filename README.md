## Overview

In this course, you will explore Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using Java. This repository includes various examples and projects aimed at reinforcing OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. The goal is to teach students how to design, implement, and maintain scalable and reusable software systems.

### Key Learning Goals:
- Master the use of classes and objects in Java.
- Implement OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Learn Java-specific practices like using interfaces, exceptions, and generics.
- Gain hands-on experience with software design patterns.

## Topics Covered

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Encapsulation and Access Modifiers**
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**
- **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**
- **Static and Final Keywords**
- **Method Overloading and Overriding**
- **Exception Handling**
- **Generics**
- **Collections Framework**
- **Design Patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer)**

## Technologies

- **Programming Language:** [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) (JDK 11+ recommended)
- **Build Tool:** [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/)
